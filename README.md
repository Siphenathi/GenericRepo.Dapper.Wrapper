---
## Introduction
> This [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper) wrapper allows you to fluently configure the mapping between model properties and database columns. 
> This keeps your model clean of mapping attributes. 
> Also you do not have to rewrite SQL query each time you want to interact with different table through Dapper.
> This guy handles all of that by providing functions that wrap specific dapper functions into generic functions. 
> Therefore, add that into what we call generic repository.
